# Introduction #

Proton is a prototyping framework for the design & development of user interfaces. It uses EJS for fast prototyping of html and LESS for writing efficient CSS. It can be used to seperate frontend code from applications that do not allow easy editing of CSS or HTML. The process would be as follow: Copy the generated project HTML in a prototyped page in proton, edit the LESS/CSS code with auto-reload, sourcemaps and other advanced features and paste the production LESS or generated CSS back into the application.

# Other usage #

Proton can also be used as a flat file system CMS, for easy creation of blazing fast webpages that run on Node.js. They are easy to maintain, code and are fun to work with as autoreload & sourcemap editing make writing frontend and visual code very easy.

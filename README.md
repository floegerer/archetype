# Introduction #

Archetype is a prototyping framework for the design & development of user interfaces. It uses ejs for fast prototyping of html and less for writing efficient css. It can be used to seperate frontend code from applications that do not allow easy editing of css or html with proper live reload.

# Examples #

- Copy the generated project html in a prototyped page in archetype
- Edit the less or css code with blazing fast livereload, sourcemaps and other advanced features
- Send html prototypes to freelancers or other teams to integrate them into your web application
- Integrate your production less or css code back into the application

# Other usage #

Archetype can also be used as a flat file system CMS, for easy creation of blazing fast webpages that run on Node.js. They are easy to maintain, code and are fun to work with as live reload & sourcemap editing make writing frontend code very easy.

# Setup #

- Run 'npm install'
- Run 'grunt project:projectname'
